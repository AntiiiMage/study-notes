## Description
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

### Clarification
* What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
* Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

### Example
* The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
* Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
* Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
* You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

## Solution
```java
/*
     * @param s: A string
     * @return: A string
     */
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // write your code here
    }
```
